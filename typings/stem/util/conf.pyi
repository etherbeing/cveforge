Handlers for text configuration files. Configurations are simple string to
string mappings, with the configuration files using the following rules...

* the key/value is separated by a space
* anything after a '#' is ignored as a comment
* excess whitespace is trimmed
* empty lines are ignored
* multi-line values can be defined by following the key with lines starting
  with a '|'

For instance...

::

  # This is my sample config
  user.name Galen
  user.password yabba1234 # here's an inline comment
  user.notes takes a fancy to pepperjack cheese
  blankEntry.example

  msg.greeting
  |Multi-line message exclaiming of the
  |wonder and awe that is pepperjack!

... would be loaded as...

::

  config = {
    'user.name': 'Galen',
    'user.password': 'yabba1234',
    'user.notes': 'takes a fancy to pepperjack cheese',
    'blankEntry.example': '',
    'msg.greeting': 'Multi-line message exclaiming of the\\nwonder and awe that is pepperjack!',
  }

Configurations are managed via the :class:`~stem.util.conf.Config` class. The
:class:`~stem.util.conf.Config` can be be used directly with its
:func:`~stem.util.conf.Config.get` and :func:`~stem.util.conf.Config.set`
methods, but usually modules will want a local dictionary with just the
configurations that it cares about.

To do this use the :func:`~stem.util.conf.config_dict` function. For example...

::

  import getpass
  from stem.util import conf, connection

  def config_validator(key, value):
    if key == 'timeout':
      # require at least a one second timeout
      return max(1, value)
    elif key == 'endpoint':
      if not connection.is_valid_ipv4_address(value):
        raise ValueError("'%s' isn't a valid IPv4 address" % value)
    elif key == 'port':
      if not connection.is_valid_port(value):
        raise ValueError("'%s' isn't a valid port" % value)
    elif key == 'retries':
      # negative retries really don't make sense
      return max(0, value)

  CONFIG = conf.config_dict('ssh_login', {
    'username': getpass.getuser(),
    'password': '',
    'timeout': 10,
    'endpoint': '263.12.8.0',
    'port': 22,
    'reconnect': False,
    'retries': 3,
  }, config_validator)

There's several things going on here so lets take it step by step...

* The :func:`~stem.util.conf.config_dict` provides a dictionary that's bound
  to a given configuration. If the "ssh_proxy_config" configuration changes
  then so will the contents of CONFIG.

* The dictionary we're passing to :func:`~stem.util.conf.config_dict` provides
  two important pieces of information: default values and their types. See the
  Config's :func:`~stem.util.conf.Config.get` method for how these type
  inferences work.

* The config_validator is a hook we're adding to make sure CONFIG only gets
  values we think are valid. In this case it ensures that our timeout value
  is at least one second, and rejects endpoints or ports that are invalid.

Now lets say our user has the following configuration file...

::

  username waddle_doo
  password jabberwocky
  timeout -15
  port 9000000
  retries lots
  reconnect true
  logging debug

... and we load it as follows...

::

  >>> from stem.util import conf
  >>> our_config = conf.get_config('ssh_login')
  >>> our_config.load('/home/atagar/user_config')
  >>> print CONFIG  # doctest: +SKIP
  {
    "username": "waddle_doo",
    "password": "jabberwocky",
    "timeout": 1,
    "endpoint": "263.12.8.0",
    "port": 22,
    "reconnect": True,
    "retries": 3,
  }

Here's an expanation of what happened...

* the username, password, and reconnect attributes took the values in the
  configuration file

* the 'config_validator' we added earlier allows for a minimum timeout of one
  and rejected the invalid port (with a log message)

* we weren't able to convert the retries' "lots" value to an integer so it kept
  its default value and logged a warning

* the user didn't supply an endpoint so that remained unchanged

* our CONFIG didn't have a 'logging' attribute so it was ignored

**Module Overview:**

::

  config_dict - provides a dictionary that's kept in sync with our config
  get_config - singleton for getting configurations
  uses_settings - provides an annotation for functions that use configurations
  parse_enum_csv - helper funcion for parsing confguration entries for enums

  Config - Custom configuration
    |- load - reads a configuration file
    |- save - writes the current configuration to a file
    |- clear - empties our loaded configuration contents
    |- add_listener - notifies the given listener when an update occurs
    |- clear_listeners - removes any attached listeners
    |- keys - provides keys in the loaded configuration
    |- set - sets the given key/value pair
    |- unused_keys - provides keys that have never been requested
    |- get - provides the value for a given key, with type inference
    +- get_value - provides the value for a given key as a string

  Makes a dictionary that stays synchronized with a configuration.

  This takes a dictionary of 'config_key => default_value' mappings and

  the previous values alone if...

  * we don't have a value for that config_key
  * we can't convert our value to be the same type as the default_value

  If a handler is provided then this is called just prior to assigning new
  values to the config_dict. The handler function is expected to accept the
  (key, value) for the new values and return what we should actually insert
  into the dictionary. If this returns None then the value is updated as
  normal.

  :func:`~stem.util.conf.Config.get` method.
