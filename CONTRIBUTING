## 🚀 How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, not just by writing code:

### 1\. 🐛 Reporting Bugs

  * Ensure the bug hasn't already been reported by searching [existing issues](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/your-username/cve-forge/issues).
  * Open a new issue and use the **"Bug Report"** template.
  * Clearly describe the issue, including steps to reproduce the behavior, the expected outcome, and the actual outcome.
  * Include your operating system and the version of CVE Forge you are using.

### 2\. 💡 Suggesting Enhancements

  * Check [existing issues](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/your-username/cve-forge/issues) to see if the feature has already been suggested.
  * Open a new issue and use the **"Feature Request"** template.
  * Explain the problem your suggestion solves and how it fits into the overall goal of CVE Forge.

### 3\. 📝 Documentation

  * If you find typos, outdated information, or confusing sections in the documentation or README, feel free to open a PR to correct them.

### 4\. 👨‍💻 Code Contributions (Pull Requests)

#### A. Getting Started

1.  **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2.  **Clone** your fork locally: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/cve-forge.git`
3.  **Create a new branch** for your feature or fix: `git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature`
4.  Make your changes, ensuring you follow the **Development Guidelines** below.
5.  **Commit** your changes using descriptive commit messages (see point B).
6.  **Push** your changes to your fork: `git push origin feature/my-awesome-feature`
7.  **Open a Pull Request (PR)** against the `main` branch of the original `cve-forge` repository.

#### B. Commit Message Guidelines

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This helps us generate better release notes.

| Type | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `feat` | A new feature | `feat: add category filter for exploits` |
| `fix` | A bug fix | `fix: command parser now handles spaces correctly` |
| `docs` | Documentation only changes | `docs: update quickstart guide for uv` |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature | `refactor: simplify exploit loading logic` |
| `test` | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests | `test: add unit tests for ForgeParser` |

#### C. Development Guidelines

  * **Testing:** New features and bug fixes must include corresponding tests (unit or integration) where appropriate.
  * **Code Style:** We primarily adhere to **PEP 8**. Please use a linter (like `flake8` or `ruff`) and an auto-formatter (like `black`) before submitting your PR.
  * **Type Hinting:** Use Python's type hinting generously to improve code clarity and maintainability.
  * **Security:** Due to the nature of this project, all contributions are subject to a **rigorous security review**.

## 🛡️ Zero-Day and Exploit Policy (Crucial)

As stated in the README, **CVE Forge is a framework for responsible disclosure and authorized testing.**

1.  **NO Zero-Day Exploits (ZDEs) are to be submitted as PRs.**
2.  Exploit contributions for **publicly known, patched vulnerabilities (CVEs)** must clearly reference the CVE ID and the affected product version.
3.  The exploit must be demonstrated against a **safe, isolated environment (e.g., a local Docker container or test server)**.
4.  Any contribution that appears to be malicious or targets live, unauthorized systems will be immediately rejected and reported.
