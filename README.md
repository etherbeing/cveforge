# CVE Forge

Personal project for storing all tools needed for Bug Hunting, Cracking, and Hacking in general.

## Development

The project consists of several modules and parts that are intended for making developing exploits fast and easier, it integrates with
several other projects in order to gain information and structure standards, for example [CVE List](https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/), [Exploit Db](https://www.exploit-db.com/) and more.

## Structure

This project structure is like follows:

|- **main**.py # Entrypoint for the software and handle things like subprocess management, watcher activities and more.
|-

## TODO

1. Generate a math modeling language that turns every normal programming language standard instruction into a mathematical one, for example instead of "for" use "sin(x)" and for conditions like "if a is not b" use something like "n/a+b" which in case a and b are the same the function is undefined, this mathematical language doesn't need to be a programming language or a digital language at all, is encouraged to use just a language definition so we can even program in a piece of paper, with the same results than in a computer (without the actual computation but with the same results if manually computed).
2. Prove that P=NP by using the before-mentioned language definition.
